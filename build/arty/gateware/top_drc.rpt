2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CLKB0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ISERDESE2_i_1/O, cell ISERDESE2_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT ISERDESE2_i_1 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
ISERDESE2, ISERDESE2_1, ISERDESE2_10, ISERDESE2_11, ISERDESE2_12, ISERDESE2_13, ISERDESE2_14, ISERDESE2_15, ISERDESE2_2, ISERDESE2_3, ISERDESE2_4, ISERDESE2_5, ISERDESE2_6, ISERDESE2_7, ISERDESE2_8 (the first 15 of 16 listed)
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 tag_mem_reg has an input control pin tag_mem_reg/ENBWREN (net: tag_mem_reg_ENBWREN_cooolgate_en_sig_1) which is driven by a register (FDPE_1) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
